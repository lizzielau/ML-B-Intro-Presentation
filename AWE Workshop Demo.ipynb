    "Keras is a neural network framework that wraps tensorflow (if you haven't heard of tensorflow it's another neural network framework) and makes it really simple to implement common neural networks. Its philosophy is to make simple things easy (but beware, trying to implement uncommon, custom neural networks can be pretty challenging in Keras, for the purposes of this course you will never have to that though so don't worry about it). If you are ever confused during this homework, Keras has really good documentation, so you can go to [Keras Docs](https://keras.io)."
